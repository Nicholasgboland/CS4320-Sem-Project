\section{Design Purpose}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This product is a simple real estate management program, focused primarily on personal, non-corporate landlords. It shall provide capability to manage properties and rents associated. Focus on creating maintenance and expense reports, alongside generated profit reports based on rent and those expenses. It will be implemented as a SaaS (Software as a Service), Using Python with Django which enforces a MVT architecture.
        \item Intended Customers and Intended End-Users are personal, non-corporate landlords. Value created is simplicity in generating profit and expense reports based on given data.
